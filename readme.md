This is a sample Node.js backend app scaffold, written from ground up. 

I always wanted to have such an ideal greenfield project with a minimal rationale.

A project where every bit is well-thought.

Strong fundamentals, but allows for exploration and extension.

### Rationale behind each file and folder
#### Package-specific
- package.json — the standard indispensable file containing metadata and information about a project/package.
- package-lock.json — dependencies of a project often gets deprecated, updated with breaking changes, or its features removed; thus making this file non-negotiable for production deployments, as it contains accurate version information.
- index.ts — the standard entry point of a Node.js package, with TypeScript.
